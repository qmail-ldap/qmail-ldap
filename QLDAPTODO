TODO:

ongoing - Debugging and testing, testing, testing
ongoing - The big qmail-ldap picture
ongoing - full code review by a third person
planned - splitting the patch into smaler separate pieces
planned - make it possible to have locals and rcpthosts in ldap
          and perhaps also the rules for the tcpserver (certs?)


ALSO ON THE LIST: (priority list)
- force forward-only and ldaponly when neither LDAP_MAILSTORE nor LDAP_HOMEDIR 
  defined 
- looping of messages in cluster mode, there is no loop count!
  Have to fix that!
- use conection less ldap for lookups
- benchmarking the code
- enhancement to debug code
- imap check, there seems to be some problems with Netscape (seems to be a 
  courier-imap and Netscape thing )
- test what happens if only uid and mail is defiend in ldap or similar uncommon
  cases
