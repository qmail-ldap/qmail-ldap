TODO:

ongoing - Debugging and testing, testing, testing
ongoing - The big qmail-ldap picture
ongoing - full code review by a third person
planned - splitting the patch into smaller separate pieces
planned - make it possible to have locals and rcpthosts in ldap
          and perhaps also the rules for the tcpserver (certs?)


ALSO ON THE LIST: (priority list ???)
- enhancement to debug code (almost done)
- benchmarking the code
- test what happens if only uid and mail is defiend in ldap or similar uncommon
  cases (seems to be no problem, or?)
- add better documentation. (man files)
- make the current code rock solid (even if it is not perfect)
- clean up and strip of the digest_*.c files so that it get more platform
  independent.  Target is to remove the "ugly" compatibility.h (DONE)
- make the complete lookup code modular so that it should be possible to add 
  diffrent backends.
  It should also be so flexible that other auth services (smtp-auth/SASL) 
  are possible without rewriting to much.
- use connectionless ldap for lookups (done some work but it seems that the
  udp support of slapd is just unusable, have to wait)
