This is the TODO FILE, so the QLDAPINSTALL file gets a bit cleaner.
This file is NOT structured!!

TODO:

ongoing - Debugging and testing, testing, testing
ongoing - The big qmail-ldap picture
ongoing - full code review by a third person
planned - splitting the patch into smaller separate pieces
planned - make it possible to have locals and rcpthosts in ldap
          and perhaps also the rules for the tcpserver (certs?)

PS: planned means we see the use of the idea but there are a lot more
    important things that need to be done first.

ALSO ON THE LIST: (priority list ???)
- improve the RBL handling (tagging, types, etc) (done)
- add smtp-after-pop functionality (done)
- add logging to pop3 (similiar to smtpd) (done)
- check the enhanced debug code (one bug fix, done)

- add mailGroup handling
- benchmarking the code
- make the current code rock solid (even if it is not perfect)
- better TLS support (better written??) (tls for pop???)
- add more and clearer documentation.
- ldap handling rewrite, with more flexible filter and attribute generation.
  The lookup code should be more modular and probably a special ldap daemon
  should be used.
- 64bit counters for quota handling code.

status unclear:
- force to alias if only mail and mailforwardingaddress is set (no uid). (done)
- test what happens if only uid and mail is defiend in ldap or similar uncommon
  cases (seems to be no problem, or?)

low priority:
- SMTP_AUTH (low priority because of POP before SMTP, Hennings patch and the
  f*#&ing SASL stuff)
- use connectionless ldap for lookups (done some work but it seems that the
  udp support of slapd is just unusable, have to wait). Other possibility is
  ldap over a local/unix socket...
