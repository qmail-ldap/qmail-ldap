This LDAP patches for qmail come with NO WARRANTY.

These patches are under the BSD license.


TODO:

ongoing - Debugging and testing, testing, testing
ongoing - The big qmail-ldap picture
done    - support for mail clusters
ongoing - full code review
planned - splitting the patch into smaler separate pieces
done    - ldap authentication for courier-imap

NEWS:

 changed the connection forwarding under pop and imap. Now it should work 
 correctly, or at least better then befor ;-)

 to have the possibility to compare cleartextpasswords (password how are 
 stored cleartext in ldap) define CLEARTEXTPASSWORD. Because this setting
 is a security disaster it is normaly off. All other modes (hashed MD4, MD5,
 SHA and the standart DES crypt) are not affected.

 Added new debug facility that is usable for the auth tools and qmail-lspawn.
 The debug-level can now be changed at runtime and everything gets logged via
 splogger or any other logger connected to stderr of the execution chain.
 You can set the debug level easily with the DEUBUGLEVEL environment variable.

 Created a new auth tool for pop3 and imap. The old checkpassword is not 
 needed anymore. The new programs are auth_pop and auth_imap.

 Rewritten qmail-lspawn and the auth tools. Both programs use now the same
 debug and ldap functions, which are now moved to new files (qldap-*).
 The complete ldap lookup is now more flexible, so you can easier add your 
 special stuff.

 The qmailUser ldap field and the corresponding conf file are no longer used,
 they have been replaced with the uid field.

 Added maildir++ support, this means especially better quota support via the
 maildir++ maildirsize file. For more info have a look at courier-imap
 http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/

INSTALL:

1. Make sure you have fairly good knowledge of qmail and LDAP

2. Read this document

3. You need the following compiled and installed
    - OpenLDAP 1.2.9 or higher (others might also work)
   or
    - Netscape LDAP sdk (tested libldapssl30 on Solaris 2.6)
   and
    - OpenSSL 0.9.4 or higher if you want TLS SMTP encrytion

   If you have problems with OpenLDAP look into their FAQ. The same for
   Netscape and OpenSSL.

4. Apply the qmail-ldap patches to a clean qmail-1.03 source tree
   normaly "cd qmail-1.03_source_tree; patch -p1 < location_of_patch"
   works ;-). There seems to be a problem with the original patch utility
   on Solaris based systems, use the gnu patch utility instead.
   A pre-compiled binary should be available at http://www.sunfreeware.com/
   or on many mirrors around the world.

5. Edit the conf-* files and the top of the Makefile (only the top ;-) )
   You can set/change:
   - LDAPON=-DQLDAP_CLUSTER (turns the cluster support on) +
            -DLDAP_ESCAPE_BUG (see NOTE)
     NOTE: at the moment -DLDAP_ESCAPE_BUG is also defined, this should be
           added as long as the ldap servers have problems with the 
           escapeing of LDAP filters (fixed as of OpenLDAP 1.2.8 and higher)

   - LDAPLIBS: the libraries you need for ldap, e.g. -lldap -llber
   - LDAPINCLUDES: perhaps you need a special include-path for ldap

   - MNW=-DMAKE_NETSCAPE_WORK (turns the patch on that fixes the problem 
     with the Netscape download progress bar and qmail-pop3d) 

   - MDIRMAKE=-DAUTOMAILDIRMAKE (turns the auto-MAILdir-make-patch on)
   - HDIRMAKE=-DAUTOHOMEDIRMAKE (compiles the auto-HOMEdir-make-patch 
     into the release, you need the ~control/dirmaker file to turn the 
     patch on, see CONFIG FILES)

   - QLDAPBIND=-DQLDAP_BIND (passwords a checked (compared) directly with the
     ldap-server (not in the auth module), so you can make the passwd entry 
     compare only)
   - SHADOWLIBS=-lshadow, SHADOWOPTS=-DPW_SHADOW are needed on some Systems
     (Solaris, Linux) for local password lookups (just like the original
     djb-checkpassword)
   - DEBUG=-DDEBUG (compiles debugging into the auth modules and qmail-ldap, 
     see also 10.)

5.1 Have a look at qmail-ldap.h, perhaps you want to change something there.

6.  Compile and install the stuff (it's the same as in standard qmail
    install -> read the INSTALL file and the FAQ !!!).
    Now everything should be installed with correct permisions.

7.  Create the LDAP user database and start the LDAP server

8.  Create the proper ~control/ldap* files for qldap

9.  Test, Debug and Enjoy!

10. Debugging: as said befor you can compile qmail-lspawn and the auth modules 
    with a flexible debuging facility (option DEBUG).
    The debug output gets logged trough splogger or your favorite loggin tool 
    connected to stderr for tcpserver-pop/imap chain.
    To turn on debugging you need only to define the DEBUGLEVEL environment 
    variable (e.g. with env, env DEBUGLEVEL=3 qmail-start ...)
    There are these DEBUGLEVELs:
    DEBUGLEVEL=1   -> Errors
    DEBUGLEVEL=2   -> Warnings
    DEBUGLEVEL=4   -> Info
    DEBUGLEVEL=8   -> Info^2
    DEBUGLEVEL=16  -> Debug
    DEBUGLEVEL=32  -> Debug^2
    DEBUGLEVEL=64  -> LDAP Debug
    DEBUGLEVEL=128 -> LDAP Debug^2
    DEBUGLEVEL=256 -> PASSWD, this level is normaly off because it shows
                      critical data (unencrypted and crypted passwords). To
                      turn it on edit checkpassword.c and increase the level
                      for init_debug().

     WARNING: on production machines don't use levels over 3 or you will get 
              incredible huge logfiles.
     NOTE: to high debuglevels are reduced to the maximum allowd debug level
           if the level parameter form init_debug() is smaler.
           Perhaps a compare with a bit mask will be added somewhen, so that
           DEBUGLEVEL=3 will report warnings and errors but DEBUGLEVEL=2 will
           only report warnings.

CONFIG FILES:

~control/ldapserver

 Space separated list of Hostnames or IP addresses of LDAP servers
 Required
 Example: ldap.nrg4u.com

~control/ldapbasedn

 The base DN from where the search in the LDAP tree begins
 Default: NULL
 Example: o=Internet Pipeline, c=CH
 Note: Referrals are ignored

~control/ldaplogin

 Username for the LDAP server connection
 Default: NULL
 Note: The user must have enough rights to lookup all user information

~control/ldappassword

 Password for the LDAP server connection
 Default: NULL
 Note: The password is in clear text

~control/ldaplocaldelivery

 If on lookup local passwd in qmail-lspawn and checkpassword
 if the LDAP lookup finds nothing
 Default: enabled
 Example: 1
 Note: boolean, use 0 (zero) or 1 (one)

~control/ldapdefaultquota

 The amount of space the user can use until all further msg get bounced
 There are two possible limits, size (a byte count 'S') and count (a file count 'C')
 The mailQuota is a string of the form figures type (S or C) and a ',' separates
 multiple entries.
 Default: unlimited
 Example: 1000000S,1000C (max 1000000 bytes size and max 1000 Mails)
 The default amount of space one user can use
 Note: is overridden by mailQuota

~control/ldapdefaultdotmode

 The default interpretation of .qmail files
 Default: ldaponly
 Example: both
 Values: both, dotonly, ldaponly, ldapwithprog, none
 Note: Works only for deliveries based on LDAP lookups

~control/ldapmessagestore

 The default added path for mailMessageStore without trailing /
 Default: NULL
 Example: /maildisk/
 Note: Used in virtual users environments
       the / at the end is needed!

~control/ldapusername
 NO LONGER USED, PLEASE REMOVE THE FILE

~control/ldapuid

 The default UID used in virtual users environments
 Default: NULL
 Example: 1010
 Note: Must match the username, must be above 100

~control/ldapgid

 The default GID used in virtual users environments
 Default: NULL
 Example: 1010
 Note: Must match the username, must be above 100

~control/custombouncetext

 Additional custom text in bounce messages, e.g. for providing contact
 information of your ISP or messages in your language
 Default: NULL
 Example: You can contact us at (555) 555 5555
 Note: Multiline

~control/quotawarning

 Custom text in quota warning message, e.g. for providing contact information
 of your ISP
 Default: NULL
 Example: You can contact us at (555) 555 5555
 Note: Multiline. Needs to be present to make qmail-quotawarn work

~control/ldappasswdappend

 XXX: not the right thing, will be removed somewhen.
 The default appendix to homedir-pathes form local passwd lookups
 Default: ./
 Example: ./Maildir/
 Note: Only needed if you start qmail with something other and overwrite
       this with a .qmail file in every homedir

~control/tarpitcount

 Tarpitcount is the number of RCPT TOs you accept before you start tarpitting
 Default: 0 (which means no tarpitting)
 Example: 5
 Note: You can override tarpitcount by setting TARPITCOUNT in qmail-smtpd's
       environment (with tcpserver).

~control/tarpitdelay

 Tarpitdelay is the number of seconds of delay to introduce after each
 subsequent RCPT TO.
 Default: 5
 Example: 10
 Note: You can override tarpitdelay by setting TARPITDELAY in qmail-smtpd's
       environment (with tcpserver).

~control/badrcptto

 This file lists recipient addresses that should be rejected.
 Default: none
 Example: user@domain or @domain
 Note: This can be useful if a spammer sends lots of messages to a
       nonexistant user from an invalid address, as otherwise, postmaster
       will get lots of double bounces.

~control/dirmaker

 Absolute path to your program/script that creates missing homedirs
 Default: none (off)
 Example: /var/qmail/bin/create_homedir
 Note: the script is executeded after the setuid/gid, it isn't running
       under root for security reasons.
       The command is executed with execve not system 
       (so mkdir --mode=700 -p does not work!) use a shell script. 
       $1 is the homedir-path and $2 is aliasempty.
       Possible very simple shell script:

       -cut-
       #!/bin/sh
       mkdir -m 700 -p $1
       #EOF
       -cut-


DEFAULT LDAP PARAMETER FIELDS:
NOTE: keywords have to match exactly, so pay attention.
      All fieldnames and keywords can be changed at compile time.
      Just have a look at qmail-ldap.h.
mail

 The users email address
 Required
 Example: jdoe@foo.bar

mailAlternateAddress

 Secondary (alias) mailaddresses for the same user
 Example: jd@foo.bar

qmailUser
 NO LONGER USED, REMOVE IT FROM SOMEWHEN YOUR DATABASE

qmailUID

 UID of the user on the mailsystem
 Example: 1010
 Note: Can be omitted in a virtual users environment

qmailGID

 GID of the user on the mailsystem
 Example: 1010
 Note: Can be omitted in a virtual users environment

mailMessageStore

 Path to the maildir/mbox on the mail system
 Example: /home/jdoe/
 Note: Can be written relative in a virtual users environment
 XXX: at the moment mailMessageStore has to point to a directory
      and has to end with a / (for checkpassword only). So Mailfiles
      are possible only via the aliasempty argument of qmail-lspawn

mailQuota

 The amount of space the user can use until all further msg get bounced
 There are two possible limits, size (a byte count) and count (a file count)
 The mailQuota is a string of the form figures type (S or C) and a ',' separates
 multiple entries.
 Example: 1000000S,1000C (max 1000000 bytes size and max 1000 Mails)
 Note: overrides ldapdefaultquota

mailForwardingAddress

 Addresses to forward all incoming messages, multi field
 Example: jdoe@new.place
 Note: 

mailHost

 On which qmail server the messagestore of this user is located
 Example: qmail3.nrg4u.com
 Note: Must be equal to the ~control/me hostname on the homeserver 
       of the user.

deliveryProgramPath

 Program to execute with all incoming messages, multi field
 Example: /usr/bin/program -c -s
 Note: the same as |/usr/bin/program -c -s in .qmail
       Works only with qmailDotMode set to ldapwithprog or both
       with ldaponly set deliveryProgramPath is silently ignored

deliveryMode

 multi field entries of these keywords
 - normal: resets to the normal .qmail behavior
           (Maildir/box delivery only if no forwards or programs are executed)
 - forwardonly: is equal to set the execute bit of .qmail
                so only forwards are allowed
 - nombox: ignor all maildir/mbox deliveries
 - localdelivery: forces maildir/mbox delivery (into $HOME/$ALIASEMPTY)
 - reply: send also an auto_reply mail with text from mailReplyText 
 - echo: something very strange, just echo the message (nothing else)
 Default: no QMAILMODE is eq to QMAILMODE=normal other stuff is ignored (with
          warning)
 Note: echo exits immediatly after the "echoing" (only useful for testing
       purposes). reply is executed directly and does not interfere with
       the other settings.
       "normal", "nombox", "localdelivery" and "forwardonly" are set one after
       the other (i.e. "nombox,localdelivery,normal" resets to a "normal"
       delivery).
       There are some strange behavior when localdelivery and nombox/forwardonly
       are set, so handle them with care.
        
mailReplyText

 A reply text for every incoming message (multiline)
 Example: I'm on vacation until next monday
 Note: works only if deliveryMode is set to reply

qmailDotMode

 The default interpretation of .qmail files
 Values: both, dotonly, ldaponly, ldapwithprog, none (just Maildir/box delivery)
 Default: set by file ~control/ldapdefaultdotmode
 Note: Works only for deliveries based on LDAP lookups,
       overrides ldapdefaultdotmode

uid

 The username for POP3 delivery
 Example: jdoe
 Note: 

userPassword

 The password for POP3 delivery
 Example: testit
 Note: Can be encrypted with {SHA}, {MD4}, {MD5}, {NS-MTA-MD5}, {crypt}
 or crypt/cleartext (but should not be used)

accountStatus

 The status of a user account.
 Values: active (no restrictions), 
         nopop (only mail delivery but no pop access), 
         disabled (bounce incoming messages)
 Default: no accountStatus is equal to active
