This LDAP patches for qmail come with NO WARRANTY.

These patches are under the BSD license.


TODO:

ongoing - Debugging and testing, testing, testing
ongoing - The big qmail-ldap picture
planned - support for mail clusters

NEWS:

 a catch all mail for one domain system is now available. The default
 catchall account is "catchall@domain.com". You can change that to any
 other sting in qmail-ldap.h at compile time. LDAP wildcards are not
 allowed.

 rewritten qmail-locals qldap code, now supports better support for different 
 dotModes. There are also some new settings.

 fixed some old bugs in qmail-local

 fixed allready some bugs in new qmail-local code ;-)

 added a log facility to qmail-lspawn.

 added some experimental -extension support in qmail-lspawn.

 Added a headerfile qmail-ldap.h where all parameters are set.
 This includes some changes in qmail-local.c qmail-lspawn.c and checkpassword.c
 (XXX have a look at qmail-quotawarn and qmail-reply)

 qmail-lspawn checks no longer for "correct" mailaddresses, now the possibe
 mailaddress is escaped ('(', ')', '*') before added to the search filter.

 all the stuff that was fixed in the subpatches. (XXX double check that)
 
OLDER NEWS:

 Added some compile options in the Makefile for easier configuration (see 5.)

 Added Christopher K. Davis' patch to handle oversized dns packets.

 Added Chris Johnson's <cjohnson-qmail@palomine.net> tarpitting patch.

 Added qmail-quotawarn and qmail-reply for better handling of quota-warnings
 and auto reply

 deliveryMode is now a comma separated list see LDAP PARAMETER FIELDS

 Fixed a few things in qmail-local

 Supports OpenLDAP now

 WARNING: {SHA1} changed to {SHA} according to the standard

 Integrated Lindsay Haisley update to Rask Lambertsen's excellent
 antispam patch for qmail v1.01, based on Lionel Widdifield's patch.
 Please read ANTISPAM for more information.

 checkpassword now supports the password format used by Netscape
 Mailserver pre-3.0 and Software.com's Post.Office (NS-MTA-MD5).
 That string is hex encoded, the first 32 Octets are the MD5 hashed
 password and the second 32 Octets are the salt to the MD5 function.

 Added automatic homedir and maildir maker to qmail-local.
 This can be enabled with ~control/dirmaker

 qmail-smtpd does logging now. This can be set by an environment variable
 in tcpserver: LOGLEVEL="X". "0" or not present = no logging, "1" = fatal
 errors, "2" = connection setup and warnings, "3" = verbose.

 Added fix for qmail-pop3d stat command bug found by Aaron Nabil
 <nabil@spiritone.com>.

REALY OLD NEWS:

 checkpassword compiled with QLDAPDEBUG now does complete LDAP debugging.
  Usage: ./checkpassword POPLogin POPPassword

 digest computes MD4, MD5, RMD160 and SHA passwords (compatible to Netscape)
  Usage: ./digest POPPassword

 solved a problem on big endian machines that caused wrong SHA, MD5, MD4, RMD160
 passwords. (Added an endian testprogram to solve those probs)
 
 added a working version of the "MAKE_NETSCAPE_WORK" patch under qmail-pop3d.
 The download bar should now work correctly.
 
 Fixed the bugs in qmail-lspawn. Changed starlloc_catb to stralloc_cat. 
 Thanks to Franky Van Liedekerke <franky.van.liedekerke@telenet.be>
 

INSTALL:

1. Make sure you have fairly good knowledge of qmail and LDAP

2. Read this document

3. You need the following compiled and installed
    - OpenLDAP 1.2 (others might also work)

   If you have problems with OpenLDAP look into their FAQ.

4. Apply the qmail-ldap patches to a clean qmail-1.03 source tree
   normaly "cd qmail-1.03_source_tree; patch -p1 < location_of_patch"
   works ;-)

5. Edit the conf-* files and the top of the Makefile (only the top ;) )
   You can set/change:
   - LDAPON=-DQLDAP (turns qmail-ldap on and off, don't change the part
                     behind the '=' )
   - LDAPLIBS: the libraries you need for ldap, e.g. -lldap -llber
   - LDAPINCLUDES: perhaps you need a special include-path for ldap

   - MNW=-DMAKE_NETSCAPE_WORK (turns the patch on that fixes the problem 
     with the Netscape download progress bar and qmail-pop3d) 
   - MDIRMAKE=-DAUTOMAILDIRMAKE (turns the auto-MAILdir-make-patch on)
   - HDIRMAKE=-DAUTOHOMEDIRMAKE (compiles the auto-HOMEdir-make-patch 
     into the release, you need the ~control/dirmaker file to turn the 
     patch on, see CONFIG FILES)

   - QLDAPBIND=-DQLDAP_BIND (when password are checked trought the
     ldap-server (not checkpassword))
   - PWOPTS=-DLOOK_UP_PASSWD (turns local password lookups on)
   - SHADOWLIBS=-lshadow, SHADOWOPTS=-DPW_SHADOW are needed on some Systems
     (Solaris, Linux) for local password lookups (just like the original
     djb-checkpassword)
   - DEBUG=-DQLDAPDEBUG (turns debugging of checkpassword on, see 5.3)
   - LSPAWN_LOG=-DQLSPAWN_LOG -DLOG_LEVEL=3 (qmail-lspawn compiled with 
     LSPAWN_LOG enabled does now some lspawn logging, only the number after
     -DLOG_LEVEL= has to be changed)
     WARNING: this Infos are logged throught splogger to the syslog AND when a
              message is bounced the same informations are also included.
              Do not use DEBUG_LEVEL/INFO_LEVEL on production machines.

5.1 Compile and install the stuff (it's the same as in standard qmail
   install)

5.2 "make qldap" to make the qmail-ldap specific programs (checkpassword,
    qmail-reply, qmail-quotawarn and digest)
    * Under Linux or Solaris, do you want to use shadow passwords? If so,
      uncomment the appropriate lines in Makefile
    How to install:
       1. Compile the qmail-ldap specific stuff:
          # make qldap
       2. Install the checkpassword program:
          # cp checkpassword /bin/checkpassword
          # chown root:root /bin/checkpassword
          # chmod 700 /bin/checkpassword
       3. Install qmail-reply and qmail-quotawarn
          # cp qmail-reply `head -1 conf-qmail`/bin
          # cp qmail-quotawarn `head -1 conf-qmail`/bin
       4. check the modes and owner of the installed files
          # ls -l `head -1 conf-qmail`/bin/qmail-reply
          # ls -l `head -1 conf-qmail`/bin/qmail-quotawarn
       If needed something like this should do the trick:
          # chmod 755 `head -1 conf-qmail`/bin/qmail-reply
          # chmod 755 `head -1 conf-qmail`/bin/qmail-quotawarn
          # chown root:qmail `head -1 conf-qmail`/bin/qmail-reply
          # chown root:qmail `head -1 conf-qmail`/bin/qmail-quotawarn

     WARNING: checkpassword should only be runable by root

5.3 Enable DEBUG in the Makefile and compile checkpassword again, this is for
    debugging your LDAP setup.
    Use make checkpassword to compile checkpassword again

     WARNING: don't make the debug version accessible to other users

6. Create the LDAP user database and start the LDAP server

7. Create the proper ~control/ldap* files for qldap

8. Test, Debug and Enjoy!


CONFIG FILES:

~control/ldapserver

 Space separated list of Hostnames or IP addresses of LDAP servers
 Required
 Example: ldap.nrg4u.com

~control/ldapbasedn

 The base DN from where the search in the LDAP tree begins
 Default: NULL
 Example: o=Internet Pipeline, c=CH
 Note: Referrals are ignored

~control/ldaplogin

 Username for the LDAP server connection
 Default: NULL
 Note: The user must have enough rights to lookup all user information

~control/ldappassword

 Password for the LDAP server connection
 Default: NULL
 Note: The password is in clear text

~control/ldaplocaldelivery

 Use the ~users/get-pw mechanism if the LDAP lookup finds nothing
 Default: enabled
 Example: 1
 Note: boolean, use 0 (zero) or 1 (one)

~control/ldapdefaultquota

 The default amount of space one user can use
 Default: unlimited
 Example: 1000
 Note: Is written in KBytes, is overridden by mailQuota

~control/ldapdefaultdotmode

 The default interpretation of .qmail files
 Default: ldaponly
 Example: both
 Values: both, dotonly, ldaponly, none
 Note: Works only for deliveries based on LDAP lookups

~control/ldapmessagestore

 The default added path for mailMessageStore without trailing /
 Default: NULL
 Example: /maildisk/
 Note: Used in virtual users environments

~control/ldapusername

 The default username used in virtual users environments
 Default: NULL
 Example: popusers
 Note: Must be an existing username

~control/ldapuid

 The default UID used in virtual users environments
 Default: NULL
 Example: 1010
 Note: Must match the username, must be above 100

~control/ldapgid

 The default GID used in virtual users environments
 Default: NULL
 Example: 1010
 Note: Must match the username, must be above 100

~control/custombouncetext

 Additional custom text in bounce messages, e.g. for providing contact
 information of your ISP or messages in your language
 Default: NULL
 Example: You can contact us at (555) 555 5555
 Note: Multiline

~control/quotawarning

 Custom text in quota warning message, e.g. for providing contact information
 of your ISP
 Default: NULL
 Example: You can contact us at (555) 555 5555
 Note: Multiline. Needs to be present to make qmail-quotawarn work

~control/ldappasswdappend

 The default appendix to homedir-pathes form local passwd lookups
 Default: ./
 Example: ./Maildir/
 Note: Only needed if you start qmail with something other and overwrite
       this with a .qmail file in every homedir

~control/tarpitcount

 Tarpitcount is the number of RCPT TOs you accept before you start tarpitting
 Default: 0 (which means no tarpitting)
 Example: 5
 Note: You can override tarpitcount by setting TARPITCOUNT in qmail-smtpd's
       environment (with tcpserver).

~control/tarpitdelay

 Tarpitdelay is the number of seconds of delay to introduce after each
 subsequent RCPT TO.
 Default: 5
 Example: 10
 Note: You can override tarpitdelay by setting TARPITDELAY in qmail-smtpd's
       environment (with tcpserver).

~control/badrcptto

 This file lists recipient addresses that should be rejected.
 Default: none
 Example: user@domain or @domain
 Note: This can be useful if a spammer sends lots of messages to a
       nonexistant user from an invalid address, as otherwise, postmaster
       will get lots of double bounces.

~control/dirmaker

 Absolute path to your program/script that creates missing homedirs
 Default: none (off)
 Example: /var/qmail/bin/create_homedir
 Note: the script is executeded after the setuid/gid, it isn't running
       under root for security reasons.
       The command is executed with execve not system 
       (so mkdir --mode=700 -p does not work!) use a shell script. 
       $1 is the homedir-path and $2 is aliasempty.
       Possible very simple shell script:

       -cut-
       #!/bin/sh
       mkdir $1
       cd $1
       maildirmake $2 # this does not work if your aliasempty is './'
       #EOF
       -cut-


LDAP PARAMETER FIELDS:
NOTE: keywords have to match exactly, so pay attention.

mail

 The users email address
 Required
 Example: jdoe@foo.bar

mailAlternateAddress

 Secondary (alias) mailaddresses for the same user
 Example: jd@foo.bar

qmailUser

 Username of the user on the mailsystem
 Example: jdoe
 Note: Can be omitted in a virtual users environment

qmailUID

 UID of the user on the mailsystem
 Example: 1010
 Note: Can be omitted in a virtual users environment

qmailGID

 GID of the user on the mailsystem
 Example: 1010
 Note: Can be omitted in a virtual users environment

mailMessageStore

 Path to the maildir/mbox on the mail system
 Example: /home/jdoe/
 Note: Can be written relative in a virtual users environment

mailQuota

 The amount of space the user can use until all further msg get bounced
 Example: 1000
 Note: In KBytes, overrides ldapdefaultquota

mailForwardingAddress

 Addresses to forward all incoming messages, multi field
 Example: jdoe@new.place
 Note: 

mailHost

 On which qmail server the messagestore of this user is located
 Example: qmail3.nrg4u.com
 Note: Currently not in use. Will be used in the future for qmail-ldap
       server clustering. Must be equal to the ~control/me hostname
       on the homeserver of the user.

deliveryProgramPath

 Program to execute with all incoming messages, multi field
 Example: /usr/bin/program -c -s
 Note: the same as |/usr/bin/program -c -s in .qmail

deliveryMode

 multi field entries of these keywords
 - normal: resets to the normal .qmail behavior
           (Maildir/box delivery only if no forwards or programs are executed)
 - forwardonly: is equal to set the execute bit of .qmail
                so only forwards are allowed
 - nombox: prevents maildir/mbox delivery
 - localdelivery: forces maildir/mbox delivery (into $HOME/$ALIASEMPTY)
 - reply: send also an auto_reply mail with text from mailReplyText 
 - echo: something very strange, just echo the message (nothing else)
 Default: no QMAILMODE is eq to QMAILMODE=normal other stuff is ignored (with
          warning)
 Note: echo exits immediatly after the "echoing" (only useful for testing
       purposes). echo and reply are executed directly and do not interfere
       with the other settings.
       "normal", "nombox", "localdelivery" and "forwardonly" are set one after
       another (i.e. "nombox,localdelivery,normal" does only a "normal" delivery).
       There are some strange behavior when localdelivery and nombox/forwardonly
       are set, so handle them with care.
       
mailReplyText

 A reply text for every incoming message (multiline)
 Example: I'm on vacation until next monday
 Note: works only if deliveryMode is set to reply

qmailDotMode

 The default interpretation of .qmail files
 Values: both, dotonly, ldaponly, ldapwithprog, none (just Maildir/box delivery)
 Default: set by file ~control/ldapdefaultdotmode
 Note: Works only for deliveries based on LDAP lookups,
       overrides ldapdefaultdotmode

uid

 The username for POP3 delivery
 Example: jdoe
 Note: 

userPassword

 The password for POP3 delivery
 Example: testit
 Note: Can be encrypted with {SHA}, {MD4}, {MD5}, {NS-MTA-MD5}, crypt
 or cleartext
