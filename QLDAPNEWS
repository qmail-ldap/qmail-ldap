This is the NEWS FILE, so the QLDAPINSTALL file gets a bit cleaner.
This file is NOT structured!!

TODO:

 see QLDAPTODO

NEWS for current stuff:

 new debug/log handling. In qmail-lspawn the debug output is no 
 longer added to bounce mails.

 bug fix in the cleaned up NS-MTA code.

 bugfix in catchall search string generation. Hopefully the last one.

 bugfix in qmail-ldaplookup (ldap_value_free). Thanks to Sascha Gresk.

NEWS for 20010501 stuff:

 bugfix in qmail-local.c by Mark Belnap. Problems with deliverymode reply.

 disallow null passwords in auth_pop and auth_imap.

 added RBLONLYHEADER logging control file and variable. With this it will
 no longer reject a mail upon a RBL match but it will mark it with a "X-RBL:"
 header.

 major cleanup in digest_* and base64 to make the code more djb style.
 Minor cleanup in some other files. compatibility.h is no longer needed. YES!

 string fix in digest_md5.c (NS_MTA handling)

 bugfix in catchall search string generation.

 bugfixes in maildir++ support. Thanks to Franky Van Liedekerke.

 bugfixes in qmail-reply

 new attribute qmailAccountPurge for automatic purging of maildirs from
 deleted accounts

NEWS for 20010301

 added 0.0.0.0 patch

 some fixes for misc. stuff from Chris Noe
  - with DEBUGLEVEL set, the default ldapGID is printed incorrectly
  - The line above says 'without trailing slash' but the example has one :)
  - Permanet -> Permanent
  - Programm -> Program
  - fix qmail-lspawn 'Out of memory' error when attempting local delivery
    to a nonexistant user.

 fix for qmail-reply.c from Jamie Blondin
  - handle precedence flag in the right way

 fix for qmail.schema mailReplyText from David E. Storey

 fix for ldaptimeout to just defer message delivery instead of bouncing
 sometimes

NEWS for 20010201:

 fix for ldapobjectclass bugfix

 beautyfied qmail-reply.c. Now it should handel most messages in a correct
 and nice way.

 bugfix for the new ldapobjectclass and ldaptimeout stuff

 bugfix in maildir++.c: algorithm has ignored all subdirs except .Trash

NEWS for 20010101:

 introduced ~control/objectclass to limit the ldap search to a specific
 ldap objectclass as suggested in some recommended procedures.

 bugfix in maildir++:
    files with sizes containig 0 or 9 where claclculated wrong
    if only one of C or S type where declared the quota of the other was ignored

 changed ALIASEMPTY in qmail-ldap.h from /dev/null to |sh -c "cat > /dev/null"
 direct writing to /dev/null resulted in a soft error. This shell call does the
 same without an error.

 introduced ~control/ldaptimeout to limit the time and ldap search might
 take until the delivery attempt is being deferred and tried again later.
 The default is 30 seconds.

 works fine with OpenLDAP 2.x (2.0.7).

 included the OpenLDAP 2.x LDAPv3 Schema definition file created by
 David E. Storey. This version is based on the original work by David
 but modified quite a lot by Andre. Also qmail-ldap has got it's own
 offcially IANA assigned OID.

NEWS for 20001201:

 cluster loop protection enhanced, now also the users mailaddress is added:
     Delivered-To: CLUSTERHOST host.name.as.in.control.me users@e-mail.addr

 new maildir++ quota algorithm implemented. This one is simpler and should
 therefor work much better. NOTE: The code was not tested under havy load.

 major enhancements in qmail-reply.c. Fixed a bug that could crash qmail-reply
 if a bad mail was sent. The output of qmail-reply was also beautified.

 introduced MAXRCPTCOUNT to limit the maximum number of rcpt to's in one session.

 introduced RBL support to check the senders IP against a number of RBL's, see
 ~control/rbllist.

 documented ~control/relaymailfrom to allow relaying based on the senders
 mail address.

 documented LOGLEVEL and DENYMAIL environment variables to qmail-smtpd.

NEWS for 20001013:

 possible fix for newer gcc. Problems with va_arg and unsigned chars. 
 I don't have such a new gcc, so I don't know if this fixes the problem.

 bug fix for the problem mentioned by Aleksander Dzierzanowski (mail to deleted
 mailfiles bounce if there is a quota set).

 cluster loop protection added. Now it should be impossible that mail loop
 forever if the cluster was badly configured. It works via the Delivered-To line
 and uses something like this: 
     Delivered-To: CLUSTERHOST host.name.as.in.control.me

 fixed multiple problems with suns cc.

 fixed multiple problems and bugs in TLS support.

 fixed a bug introduced with the bitmask support for debug outputs.

 cleanup at different locations to respect the signedness of variables

 added bitmask support for debug outputs, so DEBUGLEVEL=3 will print error and
 warnings but DEBUGLEVEL=2 only warnings. Note: init_debug's 2nd argument has
 changed, it's now a binary mask that is binary anded with the debuglevel. 
 e.g.  to disable PASSWD outputs use something like -1^256 as 2nd argument.

 added some defines for better testing:
   use -DPORT_SMTP="alternate smtp port", -DPORT_LDAP="alternate ldap port" and
       -DPORT_QMQP="alternate qmqp port" to change those ports.

NEWS for 20000701 patch:

 if the LDAP server is down put the message back into the queue instead of
 bouncing

 correct spelling errors in many files

 forcing forwardonly and ldaponly when neither LDAP_MAILSTORE nor LDAP_HOMEDIR
 is defined

 bugfixes in hier.c and install-big.c to install qmail-ldaplookup with correct
 0700 permission, as told in the QLDAPINSTALL file

 bug fix in checkpassword.c and qmail-ldaplookup.c with wrong index to the 
 LDAP args array. Thanks to Ricardo Cerqueira

 small bug fix in qmail-ldaplookup, fixed a wrong output.

 added possible connection less LDAP support. Untested because slapd does not
 support cladp until now. To turn it on use -DUSE_CLDAP as LDAPFLAGS

NEWS for 20000601 patch:

 update of the QLDAP* files

 bug fix in maildir++.c and qmail-local.c, now quota_add should add the correct 
 size of the mail. Until now only the message without DTLINE and RPLINE was 
 sized

 bugfixes in "empty file list :)"


NEWS for 20000501 patch (and some also for 20000401):
 
 Add the new control files and their meaning to qmail-showctl
 You can use qmail-showctl to check your setup.

 added new tool qmail-ldaplookup with this program you can check the ldap
 db entries. Similar to the old checkpassword with debug support.
 Usage: qmail-ldaplookup {-m mailaddress | -u userid [passwd]}
 NOTE: because this tool could show critical data (like the hashed passwd)
       it is installed with mode 000 (no rights for anybody)
       You should only give root the permission to start it.

 new mailMessageStore/homeDirectory handling.
 Because a lot of people requested it and because I was also unhappy with it
 I have rewritten/enhanced the mailMessageStore handling.
 Now the homedir and aliasempty are set via both 
 mailMessageStore (LDAP_MAILSTORE) and homeDirectory (LDAP_HOMEDIR).
  It works like this:
    IF LDAP_HOMEDIR exists it is used as $HOME (qmail-locals 3rd ARGV)
      IF also LDAP_MAILSTORE exists LDAP_MAILSTORE is used as aliasempty
        (last ARGV of qmail-local)
      ELSE (no LDAP_MAILSTORE ) use the aliasempty specified 
        in /var/qmail/rc or similar
      FI
    ELSE IF LDAP_MAILSTORE exists but no LDAP_HOMEDIR exists
      IF LDAP_MAILSTORE is absolute use LDAP_MAILSTORE as 
        $HOME and use standard aliasempty
      ELSE (LDAP_MAILSTORE not absolute) use control/ldapmessagestore as
        prefix to LDAP_MAILSTORE and use this as $HOME and use std. aliasempty
    ELSE neither LDAP_MAILSTORE nor LDAP_HOMEDIR exists
      use ~alias as $HOME and ALIASDEVNULL as aliasempty 
    FI
  
  NOTE: the case neither LDAP_MAILSTORE nor LDAP_HOMEDIR is a bit special
        ~alias is installed as root.qmail mode 02755 (rwxr-sr-x) so no user
        can write to this directory. ALIASDEVNULL is defined in qmail-ldap.h
        normally /dev/null can be used (forward-only and ldaponly will be forced
        in the next release) or a special alert tool can be used 
        ("|/var/qmail/bin/myalerttool")
  NOTE2: if you use "homeDirectory" and "mailMessageStore" in an incompatible 
        way and you want the old behavior back define LDAP_HOMEDIR in 
        qmail-ldap.h as an nonexistent ldap db field like noHomeDirectory.

 new check algorithm, I think it's faster and better.
 Have a look at check.c. At the end of the file there is a array with all
 ASCII chars (7bit). You can allow or deny char by adding:
  DENY_ALL:   always deny this char
  ALLOW_ALL:  always allow this char
  ALLOW_USER: allow this char for username checks (chck_user)
  DENY_USER:  deny this char for username checks (chck_user)
  ALLOW_PATH: allow this char for path checks (chck_path)
  DENY_PATH:  deny this char for path checks (chck_path)
  ALLOW_PROG: allow this char for program checks (chck_prog)
  DENY_PROG:  deny this char for program checks (chck_prog)
  NOT_FIRST:  deny this char at the beginning of a string
  SPACE:      alias to ALLOW_PROG
  PARANOIA:   deny most shell special chars like '|' or '*' for program checks
              can be turned on or of in qmail-ldap.h
  Example:
   /* 7  \007 ^G */ DENY_ALL, /* deny control chars */
   /* 45 '-'     */ ALLOW_ALL|NOT_FIRST, /* allowed but not first */
   /* 47 '/'     */ ALLOW_ALL&DENY_USER, /* allowed only for path and prog */
   /* 58 ':'     */ ALLOW_PROG|ALLOW_PATH, /* like before */
 
  As you can see ALLOWs have to be ORed together whereas DENYs have to be ANDed
  NOT_FIRST has to be ORed and PARANOIA has to be ANDed.

 getcwd and chdir no longer used in qldap-ldaplib.c init_ldap function. 

 changed the connection forwarding under pop and imap. Now it should work 
 correctly, or at least better then before ;-)

 major cleanup in maildir++ support (mainly maildir++.c)
 
 bugfixes in qmail-lspawn.c, qmail-reply.c and checkpassword.c
 

NEWS for previous releases:

 Added new debug facility that is usable for the auth tools and qmail-lspawn.
 The debug-level can now be changed at runtime and everything gets logged via
 splogger or any other logger connected to stderr of the execution chain.
 You can set the debug level easily with the DEUBUGLEVEL environment variable.

 Created a new auth tool for pop3 and imap. The old checkpassword is not 
 needed anymore. The new programs are auth_pop and auth_imap.
 To have the possibility to compare cleartextpasswords (password how are 
 stored clear text in ldap) define CLEARTEXTPASSWORD. Because this setting
 is a security disaster it is normally off. All other modes (hashed MD4, MD5,
 SHA and the standard DES crypt) are not affected.
 
 Rewritten qmail-lspawn and the auth tools. Both programs use now the same 
 debug and ldap functions, which are now moved to new files (qldap-*).
 The complete ldap lookup is now more flexible, so you can easier add your 
 special stuff.

 The qmailUser ldap field and the corresponding conf file are no longer used,
 they have been replaced with the uid field.

 Added maildir++ support, this means especially better quota support via the
 maildir++ maildirsize file. For more info have a look at courier-imap
 http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/

 Added signal-handler for qmail-lspawn, now with a SIGHUP the qmail-lspawn
 parent process reloads the his settings ( via the ~control files )

 Added cluster support, use -DQLDAP_CLUSTER for enabling.

 Removed PWOPTS=-DLOOK_UP_PASSWD because it was only for checkpassword
 and with ldaplocaldelivery you get the same result on the fly.

 Few minor bugfixes (qmail-qmqpd.c, qmail-qmtpd.c, receive.c)

 Updated QLDAPINSTALL and added new QLDAPNEWS because QLDAPINSTALL was
 getting to long.

 Changed the make process, now with the make setup check also the qmail-ldap
 parts are build and installed. Have fun ...

 Few minor bugfixes (accountStatus, AUTO_MAILDIRMAKE)

 Hack in the LDAP search filter escape function due to a bug in most LDAP
 servers. Instead of escaping the wildchars we replace them with '_' as 
 long as -DLDAP_ESCAPE_BUG is present. (see Makefile)

 a catch all mail for one domain system is now available. The default
 catchall account is "catchall@domain.com". You can change that to any
 other sting in qmail-ldap.h at compile time. LDAP wildcards are not
 allowed.
 Due to a bug in the LDAP servers wildcards escaping does not work, so pay
 attention.

 rewritten qmail-locals qldap code, now supports better support for different 
 dotModes. There are also some new settings.

 fixed some old bugs in qmail-local

 fixed already some bugs in new qmail-local code ;-)

 added a log facility to qmail-lspawn.

 added some experimental -extension support in qmail-lspawn.

 Added a headerfile qmail-ldap.h where all parameters are set.
 This includes some changes in qmail-local.c qmail-lspawn.c and checkpassword.c

 qmail-lspawn checks no longer for "correct" mailaddresses, now the possible
 mailaddress is escaped ('(', ')', '*') before added to the search filter.

 all the stuff that was fixed in the subpatches. (XXX double check that)
 
 Added some compile options in the Makefile for easier configuration (see 5.)

 Added Christopher K. Davis' patch to handle oversized dns packets.

 Added Chris Johnson's <cjohnson-qmail@palomine.net> tarpitting patch.

 Added qmail-quotawarn and qmail-reply for better handling of quota-warnings
 and auto reply

 deliveryMode is now a comma separated list see LDAP PARAMETER FIELDS

 Fixed a few things in qmail-local

 Supports OpenLDAP now

 WARNING: {SHA1} changed to {SHA} according to the standard

 Integrated Lindsay Haisley update to Rask Lambertsen's excellent
 antispam patch for qmail v1.01, based on Lionel Widdifield's patch.
 Please read ANTISPAM for more information.

 checkpassword now supports the password format used by Netscape
 Mailserver pre-3.0 and Software.com's Post.Office (NS-MTA-MD5).
 That string is hex encoded, the first 32 Octets are the MD5 hashed
 password and the second 32 Octets are the salt to the MD5 function.

 Added automatic homedir and maildir maker to qmail-local.
 This can be enabled with ~control/dirmaker

 qmail-smtpd does logging now. This can be set by an environment variable
 in tcpserver: LOGLEVEL="X". "0" or not present = no logging, "1" = fatal
 errors, "2" = connection setup and warnings, "3" = verbose.

 Added fix for qmail-pop3d stat command bug found by Aaron Nabil
 <nabil@spiritone.com>.

 checkpassword compiled with QLDAPDEBUG now does complete LDAP debugging.
  Usage: ./checkpassword POPLogin POPPassword

 digest computes MD4, MD5, RMD160 and SHA passwords (compatible to Netscape)
  Usage: ./digest POPPassword

 solved a problem on big endian machines that caused wrong SHA, MD5, MD4, 
 RMD160 passwords. (Added an endian testprogram to solve those probs)
 
 added a working version of the "MAKE_NETSCAPE_WORK" patch under qmail-pop3d.
 The download bar should now work correctly.
 
 Fixed the bugs in qmail-lspawn. Changed stralloc_catb to stralloc_cat. 
 Thanks to Franky Van Liedekerke <franky.van.liedekerke@telenet.be>
