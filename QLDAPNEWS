This LDAP patches for qmail come with NO WARRANTY.

These patches are under the BSD license.

This is the NEWS and TODO FILE, so the QLDAPINSTALL file gets a bit cleaner.
This file is NOT structured!!

TODO:

ongoing - Debugging and testing, testing, testing
ongoing - The big qmail-ldap picture
done    - support for mail clusters
planned - full code review
planned - splitting the patch into smaler separate pieces
planned - ldap authentication for courier-imap

NEWS:

 Added new debug facility that is usable for the auth tools and qmail-lspawn.
 The debug-level can now be changed at runtime and everything gets logged via
 splogger or any other logger connected to stderr of the execution chain.

 Created a new auth tool for pop3 and imap. The old checkpassword is not 
 needed anymore. The new programs are auth_pop and auth_imap.
 
 Rewritten qmail-lspawn and the auth tools. Both programs use now the same 
 debug and ldap functions, which are now moved to new files (qldap-*).

 Added maildir++ support, this means especially better quota support via the
 maildir++ maildirsize file. For more info have a look at courier-imap
 http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/

OLDER NEWS:

 Added signal-handler for qmail-lspawn, now with a SIGHUP the qmail-lspawn
 parent process reloads the his settings ( via the ~control files )

 Added cluster support, use -DQLDAP_CLUSTER for enabling.

 Removed PWOPTS=-DLOOK_UP_PASSWD because it was only for checkpassword
 and with ldaplocaldelivery you get the same result on the fly.

 Few minor bug fixes (qmail-qmqpd.c, qmail-qmtpd.c, receive.c)

 Updated QLDAPINSTALL and added new QLDAPNEWS because QLDAPINSTALL was
 getting to long.

 Changed the make process, now with the make setup check also the qmail-ldap
 parts are build and installed. Have fun ...

 Few minor bug fixes (accountStatus, AUTO_MAILDIRMAKE)

 Hack in the LDAP serch filter escape function due to a bug in most LDAP
 servers. Instead of escapeing the wildchars we replace them with '_' as 
 long as -DLDAP_ESCAPE_BUG is present. (see Makefile)

 a catch all mail for one domain system is now available. The default
 catchall account is "catchall@domain.com". You can change that to any
 other sting in qmail-ldap.h at compile time. LDAP wildcards are not
 allowed.
 Due to a bug in the LDAP servers wildcards escaping does not work, so pay
 attention.

 rewritten qmail-locals qldap code, now supports better support for different 
 dotModes. There are also some new settings.

 fixed some old bugs in qmail-local

 fixed allready some bugs in new qmail-local code ;-)

 added a log facility to qmail-lspawn.

 added some experimental -extension support in qmail-lspawn.

 Added a headerfile qmail-ldap.h where all parameters are set.
 This includes some changes in qmail-local.c qmail-lspawn.c and checkpassword.c

 qmail-lspawn checks no longer for "correct" mailaddresses, now the possibe
 mailaddress is escaped ('(', ')', '*') before added to the search filter.

 all the stuff that was fixed in the subpatches. (XXX double check that)
 
 Added some compile options in the Makefile for easier configuration (see 5.)

 Added Christopher K. Davis' patch to handle oversized dns packets.

 Added Chris Johnson's <cjohnson-qmail@palomine.net> tarpitting patch.

 Added qmail-quotawarn and qmail-reply for better handling of quota-warnings
 and auto reply

 deliveryMode is now a comma separated list see LDAP PARAMETER FIELDS

 Fixed a few things in qmail-local

 Supports OpenLDAP now

 WARNING: {SHA1} changed to {SHA} according to the standard

 Integrated Lindsay Haisley update to Rask Lambertsen's excellent
 antispam patch for qmail v1.01, based on Lionel Widdifield's patch.
 Please read ANTISPAM for more information.

 checkpassword now supports the password format used by Netscape
 Mailserver pre-3.0 and Software.com's Post.Office (NS-MTA-MD5).
 That string is hex encoded, the first 32 Octets are the MD5 hashed
 password and the second 32 Octets are the salt to the MD5 function.

 Added automatic homedir and maildir maker to qmail-local.
 This can be enabled with ~control/dirmaker

 qmail-smtpd does logging now. This can be set by an environment variable
 in tcpserver: LOGLEVEL="X". "0" or not present = no logging, "1" = fatal
 errors, "2" = connection setup and warnings, "3" = verbose.

 Added fix for qmail-pop3d stat command bug found by Aaron Nabil
 <nabil@spiritone.com>.

 checkpassword compiled with QLDAPDEBUG now does complete LDAP debugging.
  Usage: ./checkpassword POPLogin POPPassword

 digest computes MD4, MD5, RMD160 and SHA passwords (compatible to Netscape)
  Usage: ./digest POPPassword

 solved a problem on big endian machines that caused wrong SHA, MD5, MD4, RMD160
 passwords. (Added an endian testprogram to solve those probs)
 
 added a working version of the "MAKE_NETSCAPE_WORK" patch under qmail-pop3d.
 The download bar should now work correctly.
 
 Fixed the bugs in qmail-lspawn. Changed starlloc_catb to stralloc_cat.
