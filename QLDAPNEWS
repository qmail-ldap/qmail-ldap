This LDAP patches for qmail come with NO WARRANTY.

These patches are under the BSD license.

This is the NEWS and TODO FILE, so the QLDAPINSTALL file gets a bit cleaner.
This file is NOT structured!!

TODO:

ongoing - Debugging and testing, testing, testing
ongoing - The big qmail-ldap picture
planned - support for mail clusters

NEWS:

 Few minor bug fixes (accountStatus, AUTO_MAILDIRMAKE)

 Hack in the LDAP serch filter escape function due to a bug in most LDAP
 servers. Instead of escapeing the wildchars we replace them with '_' as 
 long as -DLDAP_ESCAPE_BUG is present. (see Makefile)

 a catch all mail for one domain system is now available. The default
 catchall account is "catchall@domain.com". You can change that to any
 other sting in qmail-ldap.h at compile time. LDAP wildcards are not
 allowed.
 Due to a bug in the LDAP servers wildcards escaping does not work, so pay
 attention.

OLDER NEWS:

 rewritten qmail-locals qldap code, now supports better support for different 
 dotModes. There are also some new settings.

 fixed some old bugs in qmail-local

 fixed allready some bugs in new qmail-local code ;-)

 added a log facility to qmail-lspawn.

 added some experimental -extension support in qmail-lspawn.

 Added a headerfile qmail-ldap.h where all parameters are set.
 This includes some changes in qmail-local.c qmail-lspawn.c and checkpassword.c
 (XXX have a look at qmail-quotawarn and qmail-reply)

 qmail-lspawn checks no longer for "correct" mailaddresses, now the possibe
 mailaddress is escaped ('(', ')', '*') before added to the search filter.

 all the stuff that was fixed in the subpatches. (XXX double check that)
 
 Added some compile options in the Makefile for easier configuration (see 5.)

 Added Christopher K. Davis' patch to handle oversized dns packets.

 Added Chris Johnson's <cjohnson-qmail@palomine.net> tarpitting patch.

 Added qmail-quotawarn and qmail-reply for better handling of quota-warnings
 and auto reply

 deliveryMode is now a comma separated list see LDAP PARAMETER FIELDS

 Fixed a few things in qmail-local

 Supports OpenLDAP now

 WARNING: {SHA1} changed to {SHA} according to the standard

 Integrated Lindsay Haisley update to Rask Lambertsen's excellent
 antispam patch for qmail v1.01, based on Lionel Widdifield's patch.
 Please read ANTISPAM for more information.

 checkpassword now supports the password format used by Netscape
 Mailserver pre-3.0 and Software.com's Post.Office (NS-MTA-MD5).
 That string is hex encoded, the first 32 Octets are the MD5 hashed
 password and the second 32 Octets are the salt to the MD5 function.

 Added automatic homedir and maildir maker to qmail-local.
 This can be enabled with ~control/dirmaker

 qmail-smtpd does logging now. This can be set by an environment variable
 in tcpserver: LOGLEVEL="X". "0" or not present = no logging, "1" = fatal
 errors, "2" = connection setup and warnings, "3" = verbose.

 Added fix for qmail-pop3d stat command bug found by Aaron Nabil
 <nabil@spiritone.com>.

 checkpassword compiled with QLDAPDEBUG now does complete LDAP debugging.
  Usage: ./checkpassword POPLogin POPPassword

 digest computes MD4, MD5, RMD160 and SHA passwords (compatible to Netscape)
  Usage: ./digest POPPassword

 solved a problem on big endian machines that caused wrong SHA, MD5, MD4, RMD160
 passwords. (Added an endian testprogram to solve those probs)
 
 added a working version of the "MAKE_NETSCAPE_WORK" patch under qmail-pop3d.
 The download bar should now work correctly.
 
 Fixed the bugs in qmail-lspawn. Changed starlloc_catb to stralloc_cat.
